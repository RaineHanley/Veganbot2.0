<h1> Vision and Outcome </h1>
  
<body>
I wanted to create a chatbot for my first individual project. I started to look on google to find some code that I could implement. I quickly found that I was going to have to learn possibly a new langauge and use sources I havent used yet. I decided to go with this tutorial: https://beebom.com/how-build-own-ai-chatbot-with-chatgpt-api. The reason I chose this was that the author stated you could build this with little knowledge. This was perfect for someone who is newer to machine learning and wants to dabble.

I had to learn some Python which we haven't discussed yet in class, so I was proud of myself for being able to accomplish this on my own. I also had to learn a new web interface.. Gradio. I ran into the challenege of not being able to really add style to my project beacuse of the Interface on Gradio. It seemed like I would need to build this from scratch all over and I just did not have the time to do so. I did figure out how to add a background image and move the boxes slightly so I could put a little personalization into it.

I wanted my chatbot to specifically create vegan recipies using the ingredients the user has at home. You can enter random vegan ingredients and it will create a recipe that is palattable.I also added a vegan fact after the output.
 

Overall, I was proud of this accomplishment. I realized that leanring a language on my own is okay. I am not afraid of that anymore. I also learned that it takes a lot of time to be able to dive into something new and really learn the ins and outs of it. My time management was pretty good as I did finish the MVP's of the project with time to dive deeper into Gradio.
